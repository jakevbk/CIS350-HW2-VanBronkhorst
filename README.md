# Jacob VanBronkhorst
  * I enjoy working out
  * I also enjoy playing video games like Rocket League, Call of Duty, Battlefront, etc.
  * I like to spend time with family and friends in my spare time as well
  * I am interested in future technology. Elon musk is one of my biggest role models.
  * I also enjoy stocks even though I'm not that good at it
  ## Technical Background
  I don't have a lot of experience with programming. I started in the Summer of 2020 as a cognate math course before I switched my major to CS. I have most of my experience in       java and python. I am currently working on C, Unity, and SQL for my other classes. I thoroughly enjoy programming, and   I look forward to gaining an internship and a practical   experience.
